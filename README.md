# tic-tac-toe
---
Mini assignment from the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript) to work on the Module design pattern and Factory functions. I will be the first to admit, this
is no my prettiest web app. The focus of this project was to produce clean modular code. 

To create players, we use a Factor function that yielded player objects. The Board is represented as a module pattern as is the Game object. The Game object controls the logic of the game (i.e. who's turn is it,
did player one or two win, etc.). After each game, the score is added to the winning user name. After a round is complete, a new game button will
appear which will start a new round but will not reset the score. 

Find a friend and play a round.
